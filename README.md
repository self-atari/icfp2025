### Possible TODOs
- problem generation ('duplicate the problem')
    - schema for duplicate persistence
- brute force (every door of every room n times, where n is the number of rooms to test for difference) simple solution
- Brute force for sufficient information threshold (n!^7 (?)) graphs, determine
  needed information from there
- schema for problem logging (sorted by question instance id, problem name)
